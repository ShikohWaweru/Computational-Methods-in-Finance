     #Calls the MCAsian function to calculate the price of an Asian call option with the specified parameters and prints the result.
     
  ## SUMMARY ##
    #The MCAsian function simulates stock price paths using the Euler method and calculates the option price by averaging the discounted payoffs from these paths. The payoff of an Asian option is based on the average price of the underlying asset over the path, making it different from standard European or American options. The Monte Carlo method is a powerful technique for option pricing, especially when analytical solutions are not available.

  ## SUMMARY ##
    # The MilsteinMC function simulates stock price paths using the Milstein method, which is a more accurate numerical scheme than the Euler method for simulating stochastic differential equations. The function calculates the option price by averaging the discounted payoffs from these paths. The Milstein method improves accuracy by including a correction term that accounts for the variance of the stock price changes. This method is particularly useful when higher accuracy is desired in Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing.
