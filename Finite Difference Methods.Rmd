## Code from Chat r-bloggers.com ##
 x <- c(0.0, 0.2, 0.4)
fx <- c(0.00000, 0.74140, 1.3718)

 ##The function is unknown; however, we would still like to approximate the function’s derivative at the values of x.
 ##The following function combines the forward and backward differencing methods to approximate the derivative of the function at each value of x.

finite.differences <- function(x, y) {
  if (length(x) != length(y)) {
    stop('x and y vectors must have equal length')
  }
  
  n <- length(x)
  
  # Initialize a vector of length n to enter the derivative approximations
  fdx <- vector(length = n)
  
  # Iterate through the values using the forward differencing method
  for (i in 2:n) {
    fdx[i-1] <- (y[i-1] - y[i]) / (x[i-1] - x[i])
  }
  
  # For the last value, since we are unable to perform the forward differencing method 
  # as only the first n values are known, we use the backward differencing approach
  # instead. Note this will essentially give the same value as the last iteration 
  # in the forward differencing method, but it is used as an approximation as we 
  # don't have any more information
  fdx[n] <- (y[n] - y[n - 1]) / (x[n] - x[n - 1])
  
  return(fdx)
}

 ##Using the function, perform each differencing method on the x
 values and the evaluated points f(x).

finite <- finite.differences(x, fx)
finite

 ##Let’s assume the data from earlier was taken from the function ex−2x2+3x−1.

f <- function(x) {
  return(exp(x) - 2 * x^2 + 3 * x - 1)
}

 ##Using the central differencing method and the given function, we can approximate the derivative at each point. As h approaches 0, the approximation becomes more accurate. The following function approximates the values of the derivative at the given points at several different values of h to demonstrate how the approximations converge.


## CENTRAL DIFFERENCE ##
central.difference <- function(f, x) {
  steps <- c(0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001)
  n <- length(steps)
  
  fdx <- vector(length = n)
  
 ##Print the approximations of the derivative.  
  
  for (h in 1:n) {
    fdx[h] <- (f(x + 0.5 * steps[h]) - f(x - 0.5 * steps[h])) / steps[h]
  }
  
  return(fdx)
}

  ##Print the approximations of the derivative 

for (i in x) {
  print(central.difference(f, i))
}

 ##We see the approximations converge rather quickly as h
 approaches 0, giving the following approximations:

  ##f′(0.0)≈4.00000f′(0.2)≈3.421403f′(0.4)≈2.891825
  
  ##The derivative of the function is ex−4x+3. We shall compare our approximated values of with the actual values of the derivative at x to see how the central differencing method faired.
  
fdx <- function(x) {
  return(exp(x) - 4 * x + 3)
}

  ##For fun, plot both the function and its derivative to get a visualization of where the function’s derivative is at the values of x.

 and compare them with our previously approximated values.

    fdx[h] <- (f(x + 0.5 * steps[h]) - f(x - 0.5 * steps[h])) / steps[h]
  }
 #review above
  
  return(fdx)
}

  ##Print the approximations of the derivative
